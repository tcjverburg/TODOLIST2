# TODOLIST2
## Application of a complicated To Do List.

an application where a user can manage todo items: they can add items and remove them. 
The structure is still fairly simple, and now itâ€™s time to create a 2.0 version of your app. 
There will be one big new feature: having multiple separate lists of todo items.
And this time, we are going to make the code design more object-oriented.
